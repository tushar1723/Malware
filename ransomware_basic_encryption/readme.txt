Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim's information at ransom. A user or organization's critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications. A ransom is then demanded to provide access.

This is a basic ransomware using python to encrypt and decrypt data for fun using os and cryptography lib from python.
